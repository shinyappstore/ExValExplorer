#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/ExValExplorer](https://shinyappstore.com/a/ExValExplorer)__

ExValExplorer is an application designed for conducting basic frequentist extreme value analysis, a statistical approach used to assess and model extreme events in a dataset. Extreme value analysis focuses on the tail distribution of a dataset, especially the rare and extreme values. For example, in meteorology, extreme value analysis can be applied to study unusually high temperatures or intense storms. ExValExplorer offers a highly powerful and user-friendly interface, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced statisticians. The application includes a variety of built-in datasets, allowing users to explore and analyze extreme values without the need to upload their own data. However, for those who wish to analyze specific datasets, ExValExplorer also provides the option to easily upload and visualize user-provided data, enhancing the flexibility and applicability of the tool for various research and analysis purposes.
